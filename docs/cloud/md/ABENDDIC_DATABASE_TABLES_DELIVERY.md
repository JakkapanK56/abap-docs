The delivery class of a DDIC database table controls the [transport](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/48c4300fca5d581ce10000000a42189c) of table data in installations, upgrades, or [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c), and in [transports](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/48c4300fca5d581ce10000000a42189c) between customer systems.

-   **Delivery class A**
-   Application table for master data and transaction data. The data is written by application programs.

-   An application table is delivered as an empty table or with a template for real data in client 000.
-   In [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c), the data in client-dependent tables is copied only if the corresponding flag is set in the [client copy profile](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c). Any client-independent data is not copied.
-   In installations, updates, and language imports, the data in client-dependent tables is only imported into the system client with the client ID *000*, overwriting any existing data that match the content in the key fields. Any client-independent data is not imported.
-   In transports between customer systems, all data is transported. In client-dependent tables, only the data in the specified target client is respected.

-   **Delivery classes C and G**
-   Customizing table for data maintained exclusively by the customer.

-   Client-dependent customizing tables can be delivered with patterns for real data.
-   In [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c), the data of client-dependent tables is copied. Any client-independent data is not copied.
-   In installations, updates, and language imports, the data in client-dependent tables is only imported into the system client with the client ID *000*, overwriting any existing data that match the content in the key fields. Any client-independent data is not imported.
-   In transports between customer systems, all data is transported. In client-dependent tables, only the data in the specified target client is respected.

-   The delivery class G is obsolete and occurs only for existing tables. It can no longer be specified. Tables with delivery class G are handled like delivery class C implicitly.
-   **Delivery class L**
-   Table for local data of each [ABAP system](ABENABAP_SYSTEM_GLOSRY.html). SAP delivers tables in the delivery class L as empty tables.

-   These tables are delivered as empty tables.
-   No data is copied in [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c).
-   No data is imported in installations, updates, and language imports.
-   No data is transported in transports between customer systems.

-   [Global temporary tables](ABENGLOBAL_TEMPORARY_TABLE_GLOSRY.html) always have the delivery class L.
-   **Delivery class E**
-   System table in which customers can make entries. A system table in the delivery class *E* must be assigned a customer namespace in the database table `TRESC` using the program `RDDKOR54`.

-   These system tables are delivered with prefilled entries.
-   In [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c), the data of client-dependent tables is copied. Any client-independent data is not copied.
-   In installations, updates, and language imports, all data is imported, overwriting any existing data that match the content in the key fields.
-   In transports between customer systems, all data is transported. In client-dependent tables, only the data in the specified target client is respected.

-   **Delivery class S**
-   System table delivered by SAP as part of the system. Contains predefined data. In the [Change and Transport Systems (CTS)](ABENCTS_GLOSRY.html), the data is handled like repository objects, which means that they have an original system and any changes in other systems are modifications or repairs.

-   These system tables are delivered with prefilled data.
-   In [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c), the data of client-dependent tables is copied. Any client-independent data is not copied.
-   In installations, updates, and language imports, all data is imported, overwriting any existing data that match the content in the key fields.
-   In transports between customer systems, all data is transported. In client-dependent tables, only the data in the specified target client is respected.

-   **Delivery class W**
-   System table for system administration data, such as `TFDIR` as a directory of all function modules. A system table in the delivery class *W* is usually delivered with prefilled data by SAP and can be modified by customer modifications. The content is transported using transport objects assigned to the managed objects, such as `R3TR FUNC` for function modules.

-   These system tables are delivered with prefilled entries.
-   No data is copied in [client copies](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/4d8062ec095114afe10000000a42189c).
-   In installations, updates, and language imports, all data is imported, overwriting any existing data that match the content in the key fields.
-   In transports between customer systems, all data is transported. In client-dependent tables, only the data in the specified target client is respected.

-   For more information about transports and client copies, see the documentation [Change and Transport System](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/48c4300fca5d581ce10000000a42189c) on SAP Help Portal.
