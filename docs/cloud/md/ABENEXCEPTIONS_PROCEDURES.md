If a class-based exception is not handled in a [procedure](ABENPROCEDURE_GLOSRY.html), the system attempts to [propagate](ABENEXCEPTIONS_SYSTEM_RESPONSE.html) it to the caller of the procedure. The exceptions that can be propagated from a procedure must be declared in its interface. The caller then knows which exceptions to expect from the procedure. Class-based exceptions are divided into three [categories](ABENEXCEPTION_CATEGORIES.html), which determine whether the declaration must be explicit and how it is checked.

In methods, the addition `RAISING` of the statements [`METHODS`](ABAPMETHODS.html) and [`FORM`](ABAPFORM.html) is used for the declaration. The declaration of an exception class in an interface is polymorphous. It declares all subclasses simultaneously.

Declarations using `RAISING` can be used to determine whether a [resumable exception](ABENRESUMABLE_EXCEPTION_GLOSRY.html) that is propagated from a procedure remains resumable or not. It remains resumable only if the addition `RESUMABLE` is specified for every parameter interface it passes when propagated. The addition `RESUMABLE` in `RAISING` does not make a non-resumable exception resumable when it is propagated by an interface.

Undeclared exceptions cannot exit a procedure but can violate the interface if they are not handled within the procedure. A violation of the interface raises an exception of the predefined class `CX_SY_NO_HANDLER`, whose exception object contains a reference to the original exception in the attribute `PREVIOUS`.

When exceptions are propagated from procedures, the following restrictions apply:

Programs called using `SUBMIT ... AND RETURN` or `CALL TRANSACTION` cannot propagate any exceptions to the caller, since exception objects are bound to the [internal session](ABENINTERNAL_SESSION_GLOSRY.html) of a program.

-   No exceptions can be declared in the definition of a [static constructor](ABAPCLASS-METHODS_CONSTRUCTOR.html), that is, exceptions cannot leave a static constructor. It is usually not known whether the user of a class is the first user and whether or not this user must handle exceptions propagated by the static constructor.
-   No exceptions can be declared in the definition of an [event handler](ABENEVENT_HANDLER_GLOSRY.html), that is, no exceptions can be propagated from an event handler, except those of category `CX_NO_CHECK`. See [Class-Based Exceptions in Event Handlers](ABENEXCEPTIONS_EVENTS.html).

-   When an exception of type `CX_SY_NO_HANDLER` is raised, this indicates a programming error within a procedure, where the programmer forgot to prevent an exception of category `CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK` or `CX_STATIC_CHECK`, handle it locally, or declare it. When exceptions of type `CX_SY_NO_HANDLER` are handled, it is therefore best not to try to handle the original exception but inform the person responsible for the program instead. In the case of exceptions of type `CX_STATIC_CHECK`, the syntax check also reports this.
-   If the exception `CX_SY_NO_HANDLER` is not handled after the interface is violated, the runtime error is raised by the original exception and the associated [short dump](ABENSHORT_DUMP_GLOSRY.html) describes it. This indicates that primarily the original exception is to be stopped, handled, or declared by the procedure. The short dump should not cause the exception `CX_SY_NO_HANDLER` to be handled instead.
