The following table shows the [properties](ABENCDS_SAP_ANNO_PROPS.html) of the annotation:

The [annotation definition](ABENCDS_ANNO_DEFINITION_GLOSRY.html) documentation ([KTD](ABENKTD_GLOSRY.html)) is shown below.

More documentation for that [framework-specific](ABENFRMWRK_ANNOTATION_GLOSRY.html) annotation can be found under [`Consumption Annotations`](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_Cloud/f055b8bf582d4f34b91da667bc1fcce6/0addf879b42e4aa2824f630803ccbdfa?version=sap_cross_product_abap).

Define a specific behavior that relates to the consumption of CDS content through domain-specific frameworks.

Using these annotations, the specific behavior is defined which is related to the consumption of CDS content. This metadata makes no assumptions about the concrete consumption technology/infrastructure, but it is applicable across multiple consumption technologies (e.g. Analytics or OData).

Annotations belonging to Consumption.filter regulate filtered queries on UIs.

Usually filter values are entered manually by the user on a UI. By using filter annotations, query filters can be influenced.

The cacheSettings annotation and the subsequent annotations control the usage of the HANA cache. In the context of the Analytical Manger (independent of access via INA or OData), the annotations can be used in a CDS Cube and an Analytical Query view. The annotation from the CDS Cube is inherited to the Analytical Query view, but can be overwritten by the Annotations in the Analytical Query View. "refreshForbidden" can only be used in Cubes and is forbidden on query level.

If the annotation is set to true, the result needs not to be transactional consistent. This allows using caches in the different subbranches of joins or unions. The different caches which might be used need not to be transactional consistent. The DB hint "RESULT\_CACHE\_NON\_TRANSACTIONAL" will be added to the Select statements.
